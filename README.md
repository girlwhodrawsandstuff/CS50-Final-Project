# CS50-Final-Project

# Day Planner Website
This is a Flask program where users can login and keep track of their daily tasks. In the future, I plan to add in more features like a user calendar, notes, and a login via Facebook/Google.

## Features:
1] Sign Up

2] Login/Logout

3] Change Password

4] Tasks

## Demo:


## Installation:

1] Clone the repository to your machine.

2] Download python from: https://www.python.org/downloads/

3] Run the following commands:
  - pip3 install -U Flask
  - pip3 install -U flask_session
  - pip3 install -U Jinja2
  - pip3 install -U Flask-SQLAlchemy
  - pip3 install -U Werkzeug
  - pip3 install -U flask-login
  - pip3 install -U virtualenv
  - source env/bin/activate

4] Once all the dependancies have been installed, run the command `python app.py`

5] This should start a local server and you can access it on your browser.
